# FBO-example
Example of particles using three methods for generating data:
- using the grayscale values from pixels in an image (loaded as a texture)
- using the vertices from a 3d model
- randomly generating them (in the shape of a sphere)

The examples can be seen running [here](https://fbo-examples.vercel.app/)
